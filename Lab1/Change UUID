# CHANGE UUID IN A VIRTUAL MACHINE COPIED


1 - run VBoxManage internalcommands sethduuid <VDI/VMDK file> twice 
(the first time is just to conveniently generate an UUID, 
you could use any other UUID generation method instead)

2 - open the .vbox file in a text editor

3 - replace the UUID found in <Machine uuid="{...}" with 
the UUID you got when you ran sethduuid the first time
4 - replace the UUID found in <HardDisk uuid="{...}" and 
in <Image uuid="{}" (towards the end) with the UUID you got when you ran sethduuid the second time
